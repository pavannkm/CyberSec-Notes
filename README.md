Welcome to the **Cybersecurity Notes**. This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of notes, resources, and insights related to the fascinating and ever-evolving field of **Cybersecurity**.

## 📌 What is Cybersecurity?

**Cybersecurity** is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.

Cybersecurity involves multiple layers of protection spread across the computers, networks, programs, or data that one intends to keep safe. In an organization, the people, processes, and technology must all complement one another to create an effective defense.

- **Application Security** – Keeping software and devices free of threats.
- **Information Security** – Protecting the integrity and privacy of data, both in storage and in transit.
