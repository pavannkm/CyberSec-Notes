# 🛡️ Day 01: Introduction to Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking

Welcome to **Introduction!** These notes are written based on session taught by [Vaishnavu Sir](https://github.com/vaishnavucv).


## 📌 What is Cybersecurity?

**Cybersecurity** is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These attacks are usually aimed at stealing sensitive data, disrupting services, or causing damage to systems.

> _"Cybersecurity is not just a technology issue, but a business and human-centric concern."_

## 🔐 Three Key Domains in Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is broadly classified into **three operational domains**, each with a unique focus:

### 1. 🛡️ **Blue Team** – Defensive Security
- Focus: Detection, prevention, and incident response.
- Tools: SIEM, IDS/IPS, EDR, Firewalls.
- Tasks: Monitoring, log analysis, patching, threat hunting.

### 2. 💥 **Red Team** – Offensive Security
- Focus: Simulating attacks to find vulnerabilities.
- Tools: Metasploit, Nmap, Burp Suite, Kali Linux.
- Tasks: Penetration testing, exploitation, social engineering.

### 3. 🧩 **Purple Team** – Collaboration & Integration
- Focus: Improving coordination between Red and Blue teams.
- Tasks: Sharing TTPs (Tactics, Techniques & Procedures), conducting joint simulations.
